## Project Overview:
---
- A fun and super easy Art Project using a few lines of HTML & CSS
- Learn how **Border*, **Margin** & **Padding** work and interact with each element. 
- Learn how **box-shadow** + **Gradient** work together to create beautiful background elements and shadowy effect on the edges of each element. 
- Learn how **border-radius** + **filter** work together to create a blurry and hand-paint like look 

## Inspiration:
---
- This project is inspired by a free online coding course by [**FreeCodeCamp.org**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn)
- They offer free and easy-to-follow coding course for complete beginenrs!
- I took the liberty to apply gradient colors to different elements and make it my own version of "Rothko" painting.
